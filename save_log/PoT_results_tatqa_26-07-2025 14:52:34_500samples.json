The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $26.1 million from the expiration of the initial time charters of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the GasLog Skagen, the GasLog Saratoga and the Methane Jane Elizabeth and a decrease of $0.7 million due to increased off-hire days from the remaining vessels.
