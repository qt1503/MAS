<QUESTION>
A jeweler in Hampton examined which metals his customers selected for wedding bands last year. What fraction of the rings sold had a gold band? Simplify your answer.
<ANSWER>
```python
# Set the number of gold rings sold
gold = 770
#Calculate total rings sold
total = 500 + 730 + 770
# Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of gold and total
from math import gcd
g = gcd(gold, total)
# Simplify the numerator and denominator
simplified_numerator = gold // g
simplified_denominator = total // g
# Format the simplified fraction
fraction = f"{simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}"
# Assign the result
result = fraction

Articles per magazine
Stem | Leaf \n1 | 2, 4, 7, 9\n2 | 2\n3 | 4\n4 | 0
<QUESTION>
Nick counted the number of articles in several different magazines. How many magazines had at least 12 articles?
<ANSWER>
```python
#List all leaves for each stem in the stem-and-leaf plot
leaves_stem_1 = [2, 4, 7, 9]
leaves_stem_2 = [2]
leaves_stem_3 = [4]
leaves_stem_4 = [0]

#Since "12" corresponds to stem 1 leaf 2, count all magazines with 12 or more articles
count_1 = len(leaves_stem_1)

#Count all leaves from stems 2, 3, and 4 (representing 20+, 30+, 40+ articles)
count_2 = len(leaves_stem_2)
count_3 = len(leaves_stem_3)
count_4 = len(leaves_stem_4)

#Add up all magazines with at least 12 articles
total_magazines = count_1 + count_2 + count_3 + count_4
result = total_magazines

The players on a quiz show received the following scores. What is the median of the numbers?
<ANSWER>
```python
#List all the quiz show scores
scores = [2, 4, 2, 2, 6, 5, 3]

#Sort the scores from least to greatest
scores_sorted = sorted(scores)

#Find the median (middle value) of the sorted list
median_index = len(scores_sorted) // 2
median = scores_sorted[median_index]
result = median
